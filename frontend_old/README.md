# SyncDoc Frontend

This directory contains the frontend code for the SyncDoc collaborative document editing application.

## Structure
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `script.js` - JavaScript for the application logic
- `styles.css` - CSS styling for the application

## Development
To run the frontend locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

By default, this will serve the frontend on http://localhost:3000. You'll need to ensure the backend is also running separately.
